# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to create an asynchronous web app that uses a web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. This is project 3 of the updated FEND program at Udacity for 2019.

## Instructions

To run this app fork, clone, or download this repository to your local machine. You will need to install the npm packages used in this app. Open the terminal and change to the directory location of this app. Run the following commands:

* npm install express

When those are installed run `node server.js` in the terminal. Once the app is running visit localhost:8000 in the browser to view the app. The user can input a zip code and current feelings into the provided fields. Submitting the form will send a request to the OpenWeatherMap API and return weather information for that location.
